# Coding-Quiz

## This repo contains (2) HTML files, one for highscores yet to be implemented, and the index.html. It also contians a style.css, script.js for index.html, and a highScoresScript.js for the hightscores html. This is a basic coding quiz that tests the users knowledge about JavaScript and shows the results at the end.

## Installation

The only software requirements are a web browser.

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap.

## Usage

Upon opening the index.html file, the user will be greeted with a brief explanation of the quiz and answering the questions within a 60 second timer. There is a button that will hide the greeting page and display the first question and answer list. It is also at this time that the timer begins to count down.

If the user selects the correct answer, the questions correct total will go up by one, as well as the questions asked going up by one with each question. As the user goes through the quiz the same thing will happen. Upon completion of the quiz, a game over page is displayed with the users results.

To take the test again, the user can simply refresh the page and test their knowledge again.

## Project Status

This project stands on it's own, but there are a few features that are yet to be implemented, such as the high scores page.
